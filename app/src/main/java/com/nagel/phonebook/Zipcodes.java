/* The class Zipcodes represents all zip codes. The class has a single instance variable which is used for the Zipcode objects.
 * The list is initialized in the constructor its parameter is an open database.
 * The constructor starts by creating a Cursor which is an object that represents a SQL SELECT and can be used to traverse the result.
 * SELECT statement is performed using the method query().
 * The method has a parameter for each of the elements that can be included in a SELECT statement, I have only set values for the first two parameters,
 * since the statement should retrieve all zip codes in the database.
 * You should note how the table name and column names are defined using the constants in the class DbHelper.
 * After the statement has been completed, you can traverse the rows using the Cursor object. */
