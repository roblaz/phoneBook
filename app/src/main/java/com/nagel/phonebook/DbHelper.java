    /* Creates two tables, it is the constructor in the base class that creates the database,
          while onCreate() creates the tables. onCreate() calls the method insertZipcodes().
          It uses a StringBuilder to dynamically create a SQL INSERT using the resource with the zip codes,
          and the method returns the result as a string. onCreate() has a parameter of the type SQLiteDatabase
          and it has methods, such as header execSQL(), which performs a SQL statement.
          The method is used to create the two tables and can generally be used to execute a SQL statement
          represented as a string and thus also the result of insertZipcodes().Program also overrides method onUpgrade.
          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Which is trivial as there isn't any code, but the meaning is
          that you have to insert the code to be used if the version number is increased (until you define the final version).
          When you develop a program, you will typically be interested in creating the database each time you run the program.
          This can be enforced by increasing the version number, and then adding the code to onUpgrade(), which deletes the existing tables and re-creates them. */
